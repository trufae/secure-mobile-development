https://github.com/nowsecure/secure-mobile-development/blob/master/coding_practices/2014-06-05-code-complexity-and-obfuscation.md
  - obfuscate code (antidisasm tricks)
  - obfuscate data (strings, files)
  - obfuscate metadata (objc, symbols)
  - swift is not as introspectable as objc
  - restricting debuggers or making debugging complicate have nothing to do with code complexity or obfuscation
  - explain how to use the PT_DENY_ATTACH and android:debuggable=false with code
  - flow integrity - verify the workflow is the expected on every function (where do i come from?)
  - white box security
  - i dont think compiler optimizations should be listed as a way to protect code logic
  - renaming symbols with wrong or invalid names
  - depending on the compiler the final binary can have more than one symbol table
  - always verify the resulting binary with strings|grep|...
  - i dont think the DRM applied by FairPlay can be in any way a security measure to care

  - add some recomendations, not just what not to do
